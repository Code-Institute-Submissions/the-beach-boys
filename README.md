## Technologies Used

The following section describes all technologies and tools used to construct this project.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Cloud 9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
    - The project used **Cloud 9**, online integrated development environment, to construct the code end to end.
- [Bootstrap Template]()
    - 
- [Font Awesome]()
    - 
- [HTML]()
    - 
- [CSS]()
    - 
- [Chrome Dev Tools]()
    - 
- [GitHub]()
    - 
- [Gulp File]()
    - 




Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.
Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.











## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


**Manual testing**, ongoing via `Cloud 9`, `Run`. Once each functionality code developed, checked operated as expected in the web browser by walking through each functionality. The following bugs were encountered:

1. **Feature x**
    1. **Bug/Expected Output** - . **Issue** - . **Fix** - Scanned code. .


## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Functionalities and Technologies
1. Bootstrap: Nav scrolling bar [template](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-scrolling-nav) including responsive web design.
2. Additional Bootstrap: `Font Awesome`link added into `index.html` `<head>` section for social icons.

4. HTML & CSS: Code added to build each section of project.
5. Chrome Dev Tools: Used for ongoing inspection of elements and to perform final UAT.
6. GitHub: Used for version control and backup of project.

### Development Process and Deployment
1. Bootstrap Template: Saved into `Cloud 9 IDE` workspace.
2. Cloud 9 IDE: Updated in line with wireframe for this project. Assets folder created, and files saved into the folder. Additional list item added to navbar. List items renamed to align with this project.
3. Each nav section updated with relevant HTML and styled with Bootstrap classes or CSS on `main.css`. Social Links CSS styling included within `index.html` `<style>`tag to override Bootstrap template.
4. UAT: Final web design inspected via `Cloud 9 IDE`, `Run`. Responsive web design tested via `Chrome Dev Tools`, `Toggle Device Toolbar`.
5. Git and GitHub: Used for version control and to deploy backup up project.
```
NOTE: At end of project and as part of the learning curve, re-pushed to a new GitHub repo to update project naming conventions,
thus, lost all staged commits.
```
6. Deployed via GitHub Pages: [1960s Rock Band Website](https://githhayden.github.io/The-Beach-Boys/).

Bugs

Boostrap CSS not overrding = Social links CSS, Footer Spacing - spent significant time, many hours ove a number of days, trying to fix this via code as it was not rendering in brower via Run. Figured out that the chrome cache needed to be cleared for CSS updates to apply. And used id / # to overwride as a higher class.
Call to action text not standing out - adjusted photo coloring and uploaded a new photo.
Bootstrap grid not working in videos and audio
Used video tag where should have used audio tag
Videos showing black line/controls nudged above thumbnail - sizing off for grid, updated from 350 to 340.
call out not responsive
Modal text centre aligned, updated <div> tags, throwing out alignment.


Be specific about the Bootstrap template used - what I use from it & what code I wrote.
Povide full credit in commentary/on files and in README.
Check for copyright notices on top of the CSS/allfiles and include.
Add anything useful from other README files.
End to End build - check all code/commentary clean, test all features, test responsive, ensure streamlined.
Check code - run through validators and update where relevant.
Spellcheck.
Push final version to GitHub.
