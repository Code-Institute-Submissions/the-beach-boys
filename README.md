5. Git and GitHub: Used for version control and to deploy backup up project.
```
NOTE: At end of project and as part of the learning curve, re-pushed to a new GitHub repo to update project naming conventions,
thus, lost all staged commits.
```
6. Deployed via GitHub Pages: [1960s Rock Band Website](https://githhayden.github.io/The-Beach-Boys/).
